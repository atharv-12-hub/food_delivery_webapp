# food_delivery_webapp
A full-stack food delivery web application inspired by Zomato, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project allows users to browse nearby restaurants, view menus, place online orders, and track their delivery status in real-time. It also includes separate dashboards for users, restaurant owners, and admins.
